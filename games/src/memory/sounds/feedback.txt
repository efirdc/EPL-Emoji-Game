timer.mp3 might be too quiet. Maybe some sort of 'timer ding' sound would be better

prefer babygiggle.mp3 over Kid_Laugh.wav
Kid_Laugh is too realistic

I Am Dracula is cool but a bit too long IMO. 
vampirelaugh is good enough but it kind of fades out weirdly

prefer zombie.wav over Zombie Moan
zombie.wav is more obvious that it is associated with the zombie because it says "brains"

prefer Fire Truck.wav over firetruckhorn.mp3
firetruckhorn is a bit shocking

musician sounds are a bit boring (except electricguitar.mp3 is perfect)
Alto Sax and Violin might be too long
those two and trumpet are usable I suppose but we can probably find something better if we have time
Snare Drum sound is super short. Maybe a drum roll would be good?

chef sounds could use some work
the sizzling sound is probably the best we can do but im not sure it very clear its from the chef
chopping sounds are really quiet. Some sort of clear dicing sound would be better
potsandpans isnt very satisfying

rocketlaunch - good but we will probably have to lower the volume

prefer dognoise over pupwhimper
pupwhimper is a person trying to sound like a dog and its a bit creepy

scream sounds are both good, we could even randomize them (wilhelm could be a low % easter egg?)

catnoise is a bit boring and this one should be really good since it is the first
afraidOf relationship and it will show up often

prefer pignoise over PigSqueel. the squeel is a bit loud/shocking
